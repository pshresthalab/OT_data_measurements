%This program allows users to select a file from a browser window with
%either two or three columns of data.  The first column must be time, the
%second must be a position (i.e. left edge), and the third must be a position
%(i.e. right edge) if it exists.

%The second and third rows are averaged to determine the "center position"
%(center position = second row if third row does not exist),and the mean
%is subtracted to obtain the diplacement.  This displacement data is then
%cut into a number of pieces as defined by variable "blocks" and the power
%spectrum of each is taken and averaged.

%An output file is created with "_psd" added to the original filename.cl
%This file now contains frequency in the first column and the averaged
%power spectrum in the second.

% Andy - modified code to calibrate both beads using either 1 or two tracks
% gives back answer in terms of stiffness per power
