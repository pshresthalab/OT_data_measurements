matlab_OT_data_extraction contains all the scripts used to extract parameters using optical tweezers. These include calibration routines to determine the trap stiffness, which is used for calculating molecular force. The change in molecular extension due to unlooping of DNA nanoswitch caliper is measured at specific forces used to shear a DNA handle attached to the target biomolecule. The distance change is calculated by subtracting the extension before and after unlooping at the shearing force. Distributions of the measured extension changes are subsequently analyzed using Igor Pro 6.32.
